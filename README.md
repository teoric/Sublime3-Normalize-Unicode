# Unicode Normalization for SublimeText 3

This provides commands that can be used to normalize Unicode to
different [Unicode normalization forms](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/).

I mostly use it to normalize text copied from PDFs to NFC, i.e. fix the appearance that umlauts and other letters have their diacritics ‘hanging behind’ as they are rendered differently with monospaced fonts.
